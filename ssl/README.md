# SSL keys for testing/demo purposes only

**Notice: Do not use these SSL keys in production!**

This repository contains a self-signed SSL certificate for testing purposes only, and should not be used in production.

This is not an accident or security incident, but rather a deliberate addition to the repository. The key is provided for convenience and ease of testing, and should not be used in any production environment.

Using these keys in production may compromise the security of your application or service. If you require SSL keys for production, please obtain a legitimate certificate from a trusted certificate authority.

Please note that these SSL keys are self-signed and will not be trusted by web browsers or other clients unless they have been added to the trust store of the client.

If you have any questions, please refer to the [HAperf documentation](https://www.haperf.com/) or the [official OpenSSL documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/).

This is just a notice for the user to be aware of the presence of the self-signed SSL certificate. **Please do not contact the owner of the repository to inform of these exposed keys.**

Thank you for your understanding.
